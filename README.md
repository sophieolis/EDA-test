# EDA-test
CodeOp EDA Milestone
Using the Air BnB dataset that you’ve used previously, do the following:
Combine the analysis that you’ve done so far into one file
Organize it in a way such that the story you’re telling is following a logical pattern
Add  additional analyses to your document as how you see fit
Once this is complete, post it on your GitHub repository and send me the URL to your repository via Slack by the end of Sunday night. In order to do so, this means that you would need to create a brand new repository with the proper name.
When doing your exploratory analysis, here are some questions that might help guide you:
What data science story are you trying to tell?
For example, if you’re analyzing price, _why_ are you analyzing price?
Could the reader easily follow what you’re doing?
Note: It’s recommended that you supplement your analysis with text!!
Is your analysis split into logical sections?
When we go over your project, here are some of the things that you might want to consider:
Dealing with missing values, duplicates and outliers
Readability of graphs and analyses
Proper handling of variables depending on data type
Interpretability of statistics
Choosing the “proper” graphs
Organization (i.e. titles, subtitles, additional text)
Easiness to understand and follow (Hint: Think about who you’re presenting to!)
As always, additional effort!
